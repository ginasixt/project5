# CAPSTONE - GroupUp

## Description

Welcome to GroupUp!

This is my Final Project for the course CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It's crafted using Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Bootstrap.

Group up was born from a simple idea: connecting people through shared passions and shared friends. Seeing two friends of mine bond over a mutual love for bouldering inspired me to realize the potential for friendships waiting to be formed among different groups of my friends who may not have met yet.

The app aims to make it effortless to find companions for activities you enjoy, whether it's hiking, cooking, gaming, or any hobby or interest you're passionate about. It allows users to discover like-minded individuals because they already share friends, create activity plans, and join groups centered around shared interests.

The project has the following structure:

- `capstone/`: Main application directory. It contains the following important files:
    - `migrations/`: Contains Django migration files.

## Additional Information
The application is mobile-responsive and uses Bootstrap for styling. It also uses JavaScript for dynamic behavior on the front-end.

This project is a culmination of the lessons learned in CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It showcases the use of Django and Python for back-end development, JavaScript for front-end interactivity, and Bootstrap for the design.
