# CAPSTONE - GroupUp

## Description

Welcome to GroupUp!

This is my Final Project for the course CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It's crafted using Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Bootstrap.

Group up was born from a simple idea: connecting people through shared passions and shared friends. Seeing two friends bond over a mutual love for bouldering inspired me to realize the potential for friendships waiting to be formed among different groups of my friends who may not have met yet.

The app aims to make it effortless to find companions for activities you enjoy, whether it's hiking, cooking, gaming, or any hobby or interest you're passionate about. It allows users to discover like-minded individuals because they already share friends, create activity plans, and join groups centered around shared interests.


## File Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `accounts/`: Contains files related to user accounts.
- `capstone/`: Main application directory. It contains the following important files:
    - `models.py`: Defines the data models for the application.
    - `views.py`: Handles the request/response logic.
    - `urls.py`: Defines the URL structure of the application.
    - `forms.py`: Contains form definitions.
    - `admin.py`: Configuration for the admin interface.
    - `tests.py`: Place for test cases (currently empty).
    - `migrations/`: Contains Django migration files.
    - `templates/`: Contains HTML templates.
    - `static/`: Contains static files like CSS.
- `myapp/`: Another application directory (currently empty).
- `project5/`: Contains project settings and configuration files.
- `manage.py`: Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks.
- `db.sqlite3`: SQLite database file.
- `README.md`: This file.


## How to Run the Application

Install the required packages using pip:
txt
Run the Django development server:
Open your web browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/.


## Additional Information
The application is mobile-responsive and uses Bootstrap for styling. It also uses JavaScript for dynamic behavior on the front-end.

This project is a culmination of the lessons learned in CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It showcases the use of Django and Python for back-end development, JavaScript for front-end interactivity, and Bootstrap for the design.
