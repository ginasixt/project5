## Description

Welcome to GroupUp!

This is my Final Project for the course CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It's crafted using Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Bootstrap.

Group up was born from a simple idea: connecting people through shared passions and shared friends. Seeing two friends bond over a mutual love for bouldering inspired me to realize the potential for friendships waiting to be formed among different groups of my friends who may not have met yet.

The app aims to make it effortless to find companions for activities you enjoy, whether it's hiking, cooking, gaming, or any hobby or interest you're passionate about. It allows users to discover like-minded individuals because they already share friends, create activity plans, and join groups centered around shared interests.
